 * What new skills have you learned?
  I have learnt about various html tags, the overall structure of html pages and using a code editor for writing the html files.

  * What has been easy?
  So far, everything has been pretty easy to grasp.

  * What has been difficult?
  Nothing till now has been particularly difficult.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  I have been able to easily search for any new html tags from the internet, for completing the projects. Since I havenâ€™t faced any major roadblocks so far, I am looking forward to more challenging projects where I may need to use more strategies to progress further.
